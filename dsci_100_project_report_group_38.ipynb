    "Based in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Columbia (UBC), the Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) is a research group who are focused on studying how players interact with virtual AI in video games. To study this, the PLAI has set up a Minecraft server thhat collects live data from players and corresponding observations. Player behaviour, skill development, and engagement patterns are all important factors in understanding player behaviour, skill development, and engagement patterns. The dataset provided by this project contains detailed observations for each player, containing each player's experience level (ie. classification as a Pro, Veteran, Regular, or Amateur), age, gender, and total hours played on the server. Additionally, the dataset records the player's subscription status to a gaming-related newsletter, which is the variable we will be using classification to predict. The previously mentioned factors are important in allowing us to explore how these predefined classes/categories help us predict labelling for similar, unlabelled data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the exploratory relationship between the difference classes and subscription patterns to a gaming-related newsletter, we will use real, untested data obtained from the PLAI Minecraft server. The data set contains all relevant information in determining which player characteristics and behaviors are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter. More specifically, how the amount of played hours affect the variable of interest, and whether additional predictors such as experience level or gender contribute to the depth of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classification model applying the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) will be used toi determine the strength of relationship in predicting newsletter subscription. This report outlines the process of computing relevant summary statistics, preparing the dataset, and evaluating the performance of the classification model in order to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.\n",
